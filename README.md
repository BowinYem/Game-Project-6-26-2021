# Game-Project-6-26-2021

This is a one day project me and brother were working on back in June (with me programming and him creating the art assets). We managed to get the walking cycle finished, but there 
isn't a proper background other than the place holder one I created. 

At the moment you can only move the character left and right with the left and right arrow keys
on the keyboard.
